## Latest post

My latest post [found here](https://h9839.github.io/test/kb) details all the best keyboards at every price range. I wrote this because I got tired of seeing all the first results in google reccomending crappy overpriced boards. I'm also very lazy so I decided that it would be easier to have a link I could share when reccomending boards instead of typing it out every time. 


### What do I post about on this blog?

I post a lot of stuff about whatver I find interesting at the moment. I get intrested in A LOT of stuff. You'll see articles about python programming, cryptocurrency, podcasts, keyboads, DnD and videogames. 

# Who am I?

I'm a nerdy highhscool student who likes to mess around on computers. This has gotten me into programming, videogames, 3d modeling and most techy things that you can do on a PC. I'll be posting guides to how I did stuff so you don't have to go though all the hassle I did to figure stuff out and everything I have learned about.

# How to contact me

Your best bet to contact me in on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/hogthardwarf) as u/hogthardwarf or Discord @The-Bit-One#9720. Ask me any question about my articles, provide suggestions or corrections or ask for keyboarding advice.
