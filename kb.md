I got tired of seeing people reccomend bad keybaords so I made an article that lists the best prebuilt keybaords at evry price range. To better understand how mechanical keybaords work I suggest [keybaord.university](keybaord.university). To anwser the "Why get a mechanical keybaord?" question try one out in a store, at a meetup, at a friends house, or order one off amazon to try out and return. As soon as you type on one you will know exactly why people love them so much.

Durgod K320

A great board. Solid all around. Unfortunately it uses cherry switches but that is common in a lot of prebuilts. Lots of people complain about the stabilizers. Modding those is important on this board.

Pros -



*   Easy to use software
*   Good customer service
*   Solid construction
*   Prelubed stabilizers 
*   Different weight switch on the spacebar to make the click feel uniform

Cons -



*   Cherry switches

Pros -



*   Lots of switch options
*   Lots of size and color options
*   Great customer service

GMMK Compact/ GMMK TKL/GMMK Full Size Barebones

Make sure to get the barebones. The pre-assembled is unacceptable for it’s price. A totally solid build if you budget correctly and the ability to switch and switch in at any time without soldering is a plus.

*   RGB

Cons - 



*   Plasticky and pingy, requires case foam
