Keychron

The cheapest nice wireless mechanical keyboards. With lots of customization options and high upgradability these are a great beginner option.

Pros - 



*   Gateron switches
*   Lots of configuration options
*   5 Pin Hot Swap 
*   USB C

Cons -



*   Really bad keycaps. The standard bottom row makes it easy to upgrade these so I would get new caps.

[Use this link and ask in the #kb-help channel on where to find these boards. They have limited availability and only sell in non US countries currently.](https://discord.gg/mechkeys)

Leopold FC660M BT

Pros -



*   USB C
*   Bluetooth 5.1
*   Amazing build quality

Cons - 



*   Cherry switches
