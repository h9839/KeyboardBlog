**Hot Swappable Keyboard PCBs**

This feature is all the range now and has become a big market karting buzzword in keyboards, mainly thanks to the glorious lineup of products, but what is it actually?

What does a PCB do?

A keyboard PCB is basically just a wire inside a piece of plastic. The wires go from the switches to the keyboard brain. To connect to the switches the wires in the PCB need to form an electrical connection. This happens when the switch pins and the PCB touch somehow.

In this image you see how the switch leg (the blue circle) connects to the PCB (the green box) through a sort of connection medium. 

In a typical PCB this medium is melted metal, called solder that lets the PCB connect to the switch. To solder a switch in a PCB you have to insert the switch into the PCB and then melt the metal so that the switch and PCB connect. This takes a lot of time and effort because whenever you want to tackle out a switch and insert a new one you have to melt the solder away so you can take the switch out and then put a new switch in ad melt new metal

*   To make it so that you don’t have to go through the process of soldering and desoldering switches, hotswap PCBs were invented. This is where a permanent piece of solid metal sits in the PCB between the switch and the PCB and replaces the solder. This makes swapping switches much easier. 

Pros and cons of the various systems

Hotswap - 



*   Pros
    *   Easier to swap switches
    *   Requires no equipment
*   Cons
    *   More expensive
    *   Less stable
    *   Not compatible with all switches

Soldered - 



*   Pros
    *   Cheaper
    *   Compatible with more switches
    *   More stable
*   Cons	
    *   Takes longer to swap switches
    *   Requires soldering equipment

How do I know if my keyboard is hot swappable?

Google it. If it says in the product description that it is hot swappable then it probably is. If it doesn’t then it’s probably not. You can also ask on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/knnflb/rmechanicalkeyboards_ask_any_question_get_an/) or find out yourself by lightly pulling on the switch (not recommended).
